<h2><p>Project 2 Narrative</p></h2>
<p>	This artifact’s concept is originally from my CS260 course, which focused on data structures and algorithms.  Originally this program was part of my final project submission, and it illustrated a usage of a selection sort algorithm and a quick sort algorithm.  The general concept of the program was to take an excel spreadsheet, parse out the data, and finally organize that data using the various sorting methodologies.  I chose to include this because it illustrates my ability to understand and develop algorithms, while also displaying knowledge of data structures.  I chose to utilize the part of the final project dealing with quick sort and selection sort, because these are the two sorting methods that I’ve used the most since that course ended.  <br><br>

The development of this artifact for the ePortfolio was simultaneously the most challenging and the most fun out of the three artifacts that I chose.  It had been quite some time since my CS260 course, and when I tried to open and run my previous program I was unable to get it working.  The issue appeared to be present in the parser program, which was provided to the CS260 class from a separate source.    After much deliberation I decided that it would be better for me to just rewrite the program myself and to use my own parsing method for the excel file.  Parsing the file required a number of considerations, chief among them being that I was not going to be working with all of the columns present, only the title, bidId, amount, and fund columns would be used.  To keep certain columns and remove others, I employed a method of declaring two structs, one that would hold the information from the line that I needed, while the other held the information that would be discarded.  Once all the important information from that line was collected, I wrote it to the vector of structs holding all of the bid information.  This method was perhaps a bit unconventional, but it seemed like the simplest method I could come up with at the time.<br><br>

After the data was parsed, the user is prompted with a menu that requests an input selection.  They can display the bids, add a bid, and sort the bids using either selection sort or quick sort.  The add bid functionality was easy to implement, as it was just a series of user inputs that were then inserted into the vector.  I rewrote the quicksort algorithm for this new program, but the underlying logic was the same as it was in my previous program.  It consisted of a quicksort method, as well as a partition method, which split the vector into two different groups for sorting.  The selection sort method was a simple method that went through and checked each index value against the next one in the vector.  If the value was more than the next one, they were swapped and vice-versa.  The selection sort is also where I implemented the update to the program that you suggested in the feedback from the module one assignment.  I added a switch in that prompted the user for the value they wanted to sort by; either the bid id, title, fund, or amount.<br><br>

This program might be a little rough around the edges, but I think it shows a good aptitude for both the selection sort and quick sort methods.  That being said, there are a number of things that I might be able to improve upon before my final submission.  First off, the program parsed the data from the excel file with the assumption that items were separated by a comma.  While that generally worked, I hit issues where dollar amounts had commas present, and certain receipts listed multiple items (with commas in between).  This messed up my parse, which required me to go through the excel doc and remove all of the commas.  I’m sure there is a way to parse excel data without hitting this issue, so I will have to go through and see if I can tidy it up.

<p>Hello, and welcome to my ePortfolio, summarizing my favorite works from my time in the computer science program at Southern New Hampshire University.  I am ecstatic to be at the final stages of the completion of my bachelor’s degree, and I am looking forward to a future where I can put what I’ve learned to good use.  I have learned about so many aspects of computer science; programming languages, databases, operating systems, data structures, and the list could go on.  For the sake of this portfolio, I can only cover a few of my favorite aspects, but I hope it does a good job of illustrating the breadth of knowledge I now possess in computer science. <br><br>
Of the skills I have developed, communication and collaboration are some of the most important.  CS310 specifically taught me how to work with my peers to develop software, by using git to update and push modifications to programs.  Software control is an extremely important aspect of many different companies, and the company that I work for utilizes our own form of git to help keep software revisions in order.  CS310 informed me on how to keep a changelog, and I learned what information was important to highlight.  Things like bug fixes and new features should be well documented so that other individuals working on the project can stay up to date on where things are at.  CS310 also introduced me to peer reviews, where my classmates analyzed the code that I had done on the collective class project.  This is significant because code reviews are present everywhere that code is being written, so being able to provide good critiques, while also being able to accept criticism, is a valuable skill to possess.  I also learned that when writing code, commenting is one of the most effective ways of communicating your thought process to your peers.  Even in my own coding, I found that when I went through and thoroughly commented my code, it was easy to go back at later times and understand the reasoning behind it.  <br><br>
Another important communications concept that I learned about was the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This was covered in CS250, and it is the general process that a piece of software goes through from its conception to its completion.  The class specifically covered the Agile model of SDLC, which is a very popular process for planning and tracking progress of software.  Unlike something like the Waterfall model, we learned that the Agile model was more adaptable and able to have multiple components being developed at the same time.  Compare this to the Waterfall method, where each previous phase needs to be completed before moving on.  We also delved into the different positions within the Scrum framework; like the product owner, scrum master, and development team.  Operating from a top down perspective, the product owner is the one who interfaces with the stakeholders and end-users to ensure their goals are being met.  Scrum master interfaces with the product owner to relay the status of the product, while simultaneously interfacing with the development team to solve problems and mentor the team.  The development team are the workhorses of the framework, as they are the ones doing the bulk of the coding it is their responsibility to communicate with their scrum master to notify them of progress and problems. <br><br>

Data structures and algorithms was the main focus of my CS260 class, where we developed a number of sorting and searching methods utilizing C++.  This was one of the most challenging classes in the entire program for me, but I really enjoyed the content that we covered.  The class started off with sorting methodologies like quick sort and selection sort, and eventually moved into more complicated searching algorithms, like the Binary Search Tree.  We also learned about essential concepts when dealing with data structures, such as how to use pointers to identify different elements of a vector. <br><br>

When constructing this portfolio, I had to determine what aspects of my education were the most pertinent to a future job in computer science.  To help with this determination I reflected on my own career goals, and attempted to hone in on the most relevant skills from there.  Currently I am working for a large tech company, and while they have many different jobs related to computer science, my current job is not largely focused in that field.  I was hoping to use my degree to leverage a new position within the company that is more computer oriented, so I tried to look at what my company is looking for. <br><br>

There has been a large internal push within the company to highlight Python skills, as well as individuals that can effectively utilize Python’s math libraries.  This led me to my first artifact for the ePortfolio; a login program, originally in java, that I redid in Python.  While this program isn’t overly complicated, I think that its presence shows my ability to utilize Python to complete tasks.  Getting into the guts of the program, it is a basic piece of software that can take user inputs, as well as read data to and from files.  My favorite part of this program was my addition of a SHA256 hash to help secure the user passwords, which were originally only protected by an MD5 hash.
<br><br>

For my second artifact, I chose to include a reinterpreted version of my final project from CS260, which was a program that included a number of different data structures and sorting algorithms.  I thought that this was imperative to include because any employer is going to want coders who are able to understand and write their own algorithms.  Furthermore, the company I work for records voluminous amounts of data, and it eventually needs to be stored and processed.  Showing a basic understanding of how to sort and process data, like I have in this program, will be a good indicator of my ability to do this with the company’s data. <br><br>
The last artifact that I included was a python script that performs CRUD operations on a MongoDB database.  The inclusion of this artifact was not as explicit as the other two, because I do not actually know what sort of databases my company uses to store its data.  However, I still chose to include it because NoSQL databases are becoming an increasingly important in the data storage world as time goes on.
